# My Flag
  The flag that i am creating is the Greece Flag and it's geometry is quite simple. The flag has 9 slim horizontal stripes which is said to represent the 9 syllables of the Greek patriots' motto. The 9 slime stripes follow a pattern of one blue stripe and then one white stripe. On the top left of the flag is a square which is 5 stripes long and inside the square is a white cross with 4 blue squares surrounding it. 

# My challenges
  while i was doing my research on the Greece flag i was struggling to figure out dimensions of the flag and how long the flag needs to be. Also i was struggling with figuring out how to proportion the lines. What i would differently is test out what works instead of not testing out what different types of dimensions suites the flag.

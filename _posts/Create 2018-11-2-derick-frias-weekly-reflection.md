title:*Learning Reflection*
date: 2018-11-2
  In computer science this week we've been working on connecting contracts and using bitmap/url with pair programming to create our backgrounds and player model. We had to figure out how to get the image as a .jpg, .png, or .gif, What me and my partner did was when we found the background image that we both liked we found it's original source and from there we grabbed it's image link which had a .jpg link.

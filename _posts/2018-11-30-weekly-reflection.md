  This week in computer science we took a Midterm exam on the recent topics that we have been learning about in class. After we got our scores back we took a look at the answers we got wrong and now we are taking a look at the answer key and we chose a question. 
I chose question 3 which asks "what is the value of the 3rd argument of the innermost function in 
                                          ```(scale2(circle 40 "solid" "blue")``` "
  The question is asking what is the third value in the parenthesis after scale 2. The correct answer was D which states "blue". This is the correct answer because after the opening parenthesis there is the function circle, and after circle if you move 3 spaces over you land on "blue". The second most chosen answer was C which states "solid" this answer had a percentage of 29.6% for version 1 and 28.8% for version 2. This could be because they started counting from circle which lead them to landing on "solid".
